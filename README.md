# Mathematical-Model-for-PAGE4-AP-1-AR-regulatory-axis

This folder contains code developed for the paper "PAGE4 and Conformational Switching: 
Insights from Molecular Dynamics Simulations and Implications for Prostate Cancer"
by Lin, Roy, Jolly, Bocci et al.

specifically, you will find the python code used for the result section 2.6 
"Implications of switching between CLK2-PAGE4 and HIPK1-PAGE4 on plasticity in prostate cancer cells".

This model is discussed in the Methods section 4.5 
"Mathematical Model for PAGE4/AP-1/AR regulatory axis"
and in the Supplementary Information of the paper.

This code is freely available, please cite the aforementioned paper if you want to use parts of it!
